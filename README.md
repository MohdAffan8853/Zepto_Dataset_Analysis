🛒 Grocery Pricing & Inventory Analysis (Zepto EDA Project)
📌 Project Overview

Zepto operates in a highly competitive quick-commerce environment where pricing accuracy, discount efficiency, and inventory availability directly impact customer satisfaction and profitability.

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a grocery inventory dataset to evaluate pricing structures, discount effectiveness, product value, and stock health.
The analysis uses Python, SQL, and Power BI to generate actionable insights for pricing optimization and inventory planning.

🎯 Business Problem

With thousands of grocery products offered at discounted prices, Zepto faces challenges such as:

Margin erosion due to inefficient discounting

Inconsistent pricing across similar products

Inventory imbalances and stock-out risks

Limited visibility into product-level value and performance

A data-driven analytical framework is required to assess pricing efficiency, identify best-value products, and support informed business decisions.

🧩 Objectives

Analyze MRP, discounts, and selling prices

Evaluate discount effectiveness on quantity sold

Identify high-value and underperforming products

Measure product value using price-per-gram

Monitor inventory availability and stock health

Support business decisions with visual insights

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset represents a grocery product catalog similar to Zepto’s inventory.

Key Columns:

Category – Product category

name – Product name

mrp – Maximum Retail Price

discountPercent – Discount offered

discountedSellingPrice – Final selling price

weightInGms – Product weight

availableQuantity – Stock available

quantity – Quantity sold

outOfStock – Stock status (True / False)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

MySQL / PostgreSQL

Power BI

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed using Python and included:

Data loading and inspection

Missing value and data type handling

Descriptive statistics

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Feature engineering:

Discount amount

Price per gram

Total stock value

Category-level analysis

Correlation analysis

🧮 SQL Analysis

After cleaning, the dataset was loaded into a relational database to answer business questions such as:

Top best-value products based on discount

High-MRP products that are out of stock

Estimated revenue by category

Products with high MRP and low discount

Categories with the highest average discount

Price-per-gram comparison for bulk products

Inventory weight distribution by category

📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created with:

KPIs for pricing, discounts, and inventory

Category and product-level filters

Best-value product identification

Stock availability monitoring

📈 Key Insights

Discounts are concentrated within a narrow range, limiting differentiation

High discounts do not always correlate with higher sales

Bulk products often provide better value per gram

Some high-MRP products remain out of stock, indicating demand gaps

Price-per-gram is a strong indicator of customer value perception

📦 Deliverables

✅ Cleaned and validated grocery dataset

📘 Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA

🗄️ SQL queries for business analysis

📊 Power BI interactive dashboard

📝 Insight-driven business recommendations

📄 Professional documentation for interviews and portfolios

🚀 Business Recommendations

Promote bulk products as value-for-money options

Use price-per-gram as a pricing benchmark

Optimize discount strategies to protect margins

Monitor high-MRP stock-out products closely

Use dashboards for real-time inventory tracking

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can improve pricing efficiency, inventory management, and customer value positioning in a quick-commerce business like Zepto.
